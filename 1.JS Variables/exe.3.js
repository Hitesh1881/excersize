// Exercise 3:
// Declare a variable isStudent and assign it a boolean value. Create a conditional statement that checks if the person is a student.
//  If they are a student, log "You are a student." to the console; otherwise, log "You are not a student."


var isStudent= true;

    console.log("You are a student.");
